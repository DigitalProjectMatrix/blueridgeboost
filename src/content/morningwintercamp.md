### Topics

The students will learn the basics of algorithimic thinking by programming the teacher to dance. We will use games to understand the basic logical operations including and, or and not. The culminating lesson teaches basic sorting algorithms.

   
In addition, students will start programming using a block-language. They create simple code that helps a monkey retrieve babanas stolen by a mean gorilla. Depending on the students background and pace, the campers may learn conditional statements and loops.
   
The instructor uses differentiated instruction to satisfy the intelectual needs of every camper.
