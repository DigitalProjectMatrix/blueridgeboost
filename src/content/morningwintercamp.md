### Daily Schedule


Campers will spend three hours daily, from 10am to 1pm working as a group and individually on fun programming challenges.

1. **Drop Off** at 10 am (early drop off at 9am is available for an additional $50).  
1. **Algorithmic thinking** (45 min).  Campers learn the basics of a computer program and how a program is executed through games.
1. **Snack** (15 min).
1. **Block-language programming** (45 min). Campers solve instructor-selected exercises from [Code Monkey](https://www.codemonkey.com/) on provided Chromebooks.
1. **Lunch** (30 min). Campers eat outdoors.
1. **Choice time** (45 min). Campers may choose their activity from coding in Code Mokey, lego robots building and programming using WeDo Lego sets, MakeyMakey, and other programmable robots.
1. **Pick up** at 1 pm.

### Topics

The students learn the basics of algorithmic thinking by programming the teacher to dance. We use games to understand the logical operations including and, or and not. The culminating lesson teaches basic sorting algorithms. Successful coders need more than knowledge of programming languages, they must have well-developed computational thinking skills. 
   
In addition, students code using a block-language. They create programs to help a monkey retrieve its bananas that were stolen by a mean gorilla using commands to make it walk and turn. Depending on the students background and pace, they may also learn conditional statements and loops and may start coding using a text-based language.
   
The instructor uses differentiated instruction to satisfy the intellectual needs of every camper.
