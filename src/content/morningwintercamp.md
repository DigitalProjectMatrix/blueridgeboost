### Daily Schedule


Campers will spend three hours daily, from 10am to 1pm working as a group and individually on fun programming challenges.

1. **Drop Off** at 10 am (early drop off at 9am is available for an additional $50).  
1. **Algorithmic thinking** (45 min).  Campers learn the basics of a computer program and how a program is executed through games.
1. **Snack** (15 min).
1. **Block-language programming** (45 min). Campers solve instructor-selected exercises from [Code Monkey](https://www.codemonkey.com/) on provided Chromebooks.
1. **Lunch** (30 min). Campers eat outdoors.
1. **Choice time** (45 min). Campers may choose their activity from coding in Code Mokey, lego robots building and programming using WeDo Lego sets, MakeyMakey, and other programmable robots.
1. **Pick up** at 1 pm.

### Topics

The students learn the basics of algorithmic thinking by programming the teacher to dance. We use games to understand the logical operations including and, or and not. 

The culminating lesson teaches basic sorting algorithms. 
Successful coders need more than knowledge of programming languages, they must have well-developed computational thinking skills and deep knowledge of standard algorithms that can be used to solve a variety of problems. 
   
In addition, students code using a block-language. They create programs to help a monkey retrieve its bananas that were stolen by a mean gorilla using commands to make it walk and turn or to help a beaver fix its den. Based on the student's previous exposure to coding and interest, they may choose one of the following sets of practice exercises: [Beaver Achiever](https://www.codemonkey.com/courses/beaver-achiever/), [Dodo Does Math](https://www.codemonkey.com/courses/dodo-does-math/), and [Coding Adventure](https://www.codemonkey.com/courses/coding-adventure/).

Depending on the students background and pace, they may also learn conditional statements and loops and may start coding using a text-based language. The instructor uses differentiated instruction practices to satisfy the intellectual needs of every camper.

### Instructor

[Ana Nora Evans](//ananoraevans.org/) has a Masters degree in Mathematics from the University of
Virginia, a Masters degree in Computer Science from the University of
Virginia, and will complete a Masters degree in Teaching in Spring 2022. 

Nora has previous experience leading programming and math lessons as a teaching assistant in 
Mathematics and Computer Science Department at the University of Virginia. She co-funded and organized a [math circle](https://cvillemathcircle.org/) for girls ages 3 to 9 for four years. Nora has classroom experience as a student-teacher at Monticello High School with Algebra 2, Math Analysis, and Geometry.

Nora is an experienced software engineer with industry and research experience. She is a 
co-author of several research papers published in top conferences in computer security and software engineering.

Nora is passionate about math and computing education, especially in attracting and retaining girls and women in STEM fields. The classroom environment and courses are designed to appeal to all students, not only gamers and boys.
