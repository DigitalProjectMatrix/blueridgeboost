## Computing

At Blue Ridge Boost, we teach computing using play and robots to visualize the programming concepts. The programming exercises use an attractive graphical interface to reinforce concepts through practice. We believe that students have to be exposed to the same programming concepts in a variety of situations and language variations. For this reason, students learn a few block languages to program WeDo Lego robots, mBot robots, help a beaver build its house. Younger students experiment with Makey Makey and Cubetto. Older students may use Python to program the mBots.


## Math

At Blue Ridge Boost, we teach problem solving skills, rather than drill and memorization. For younger students, we offer math circle type classes, in which students solve challenging problems in groups. We also teach pre-algebra, algebra, geometry, pre-calculus, and calulus using the Art of Problem Solving textbooks, suplemented with Desmos activities to build a visual intuition, feedback on written solution to learn mathematical writing, and group work on performance tasks where the students apply the material learned in a novel situation.
