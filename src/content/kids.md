## Computing

Elementary and middle-school students learn to program using a graphical interface, but no gaming. We use the Code Monkey platform for coding practice and teach students the typical programming structures such as sequential execution, conditionals, and loops. Students also learn well-knows algorithms through play, before coding them.

## Math

At Blue Ridge Boost, we teach problem solving skills, rather than drill and memorization. For younger students, we offer math circle type classes, in which students solve challenging problems in groups. We also teach pre-algebra, algebra, geometry, pre-calculus, and calulus using the Art of Problem Solving textbooks, suplemented with Desmos activities to build a visual intuition, feedback on written solution to learn mathematical writing, and group work on performance tasks where the students apply the material learned in a novel situation.
